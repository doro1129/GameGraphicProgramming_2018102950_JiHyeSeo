# Lab 01: Direct3D 11 Basics

Students registered in the Game Graphics Programming course will conduct each lab based on Direct3D 11. Each lab works are an incremental development of a basic rendering engine, thus they are not independent. For this reason, we recommend the students to stay focused to the teaching assistant (TA). Through this lab, one can develop a Direct3D 11 environment based on Windows operating system.
